The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   TEMP - ( default=-1 ) temperature. If not specified tries to get 
                          it from MD engine 
                    ARG - the label of the internal energy of the system. If volume 
                          is fixed it is calculated by the \ref ENERGY colvar 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
        NO_GEOM_SPACING - ( default=off ) do not use geometrical spacing in 
                          temperature, but instead linear spacing in inverse temperature 
               TEMP_MIN - the minimum of the temperature range 
               TEMP_MAX - the maximum of the temperature range 
             TEMP_STEPS - the number of steps in temperature 
           TEMP_SET_ALL - manually set all the temperatures
