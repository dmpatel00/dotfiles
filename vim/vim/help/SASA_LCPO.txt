Short helpfile for action SASA_LCPO
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the group of atoms that you are calculating the SASA for. 
                          For more information on how to specify lists of atoms see \ref 
                          Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   TYPE - ( default=TOTAL ) The type of calculation you want to 
                          perform. Can be TOTAL or TRANSFER 
              NL_STRIDE - The frequency with which the neighbor list is updated. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
             DELTAGFILE - a file containing the free energy values for backbone and 
                          sidechains. Necessary only if TYPE = TRANSFER. A Python script for the 
                          computation of free energy of transfer values to describe the effect of 
                          osmolyte concentration, temperature and pressure is freely available 
                          at https://github.com/andrea-arsiccio/DeltaG-calculation. The 
                          script automatically outputs a DeltaG.dat file compatible with 
                          this SASA module. If TYPE = TRANSFER and no DELTAGFILE is 
                          provided, the free energy values are those describing the effect of 
                          temperature, and are computed using the temperature value passed by the 
                          MD engine 
               APPROACH - either approach 2 or 3. Necessary only if TYPE = TRANSFER 
                          and no DELTAGFILE is provided. If TYPE = TRANSFER and no 
                          DELTAGFILE is provided, the free energy values are those describing 
                          the effect of temperature, and the program must know if 
                          approach 2 or 3 (as described in Arsiccio and Shea, Protein Cold 
                          Denaturation in Implicit Solvent Simulations: A Transfer Free Energy 
                          Approach, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2021) needs to be used to compute them
