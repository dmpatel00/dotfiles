Short helpfile for action SKETCHMAP_READ
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

      HIGH_DIM_FUNCTION - ( default=as in input action ) the parameters of the 
                          switching function in the high dimensional space 
       LOW_DIM_FUNCTION - ( default=as in input action ) the parameters of the 
                          switching function in the low dimensional space 
               MIXPARAM - ( default=0.0 ) the amount of the pure distances to mix 
                          into the stress function 
                   TYPE - ( default=OPTIMAL-FAST ) the manner in which distances are 
                          calculated. More information on the different metrics that are 
                          available in PLUMED can be found in the section of the manual on \ref 
                          dists 
              REFERENCE - the file containing the sketch-map projection 
               PROPERTY - the property to be used in the index. This should be in the 
                          REMARK of the reference 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not use 
                          MPI 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
         DISABLE_CHECKS - ( default=off ) disable checks on reference input 
                          structures.
