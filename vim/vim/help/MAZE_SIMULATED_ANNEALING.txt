The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                 LIGAND - Indices of ligand atoms.. For more information on how to 
                          specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 
                PROTEIN - Indices of protein atoms.. For more information on how to 
                          specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 N_ITER - Number of optimization steps. Required only for optimizers, 
                          do not pass this keyword to the fake optimizers (results in 
                          crash) , e.g., random walk, steered MD, or random acceleration MD. 
       OPTIMIZER_STRIDE - Optimizer stride. Sets up a callback function that launches 
                          the optimization process every OPTIMIZER_STRIDE. 
  PROBABILITY_DECREASER - Temperature-like parameter that is decreased during 
                          optimization to modify the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. 
                COOLING - Reduction factor for PROBABILITY_DECREASER, should be in 
                          (0, 1]. 
         COOLING_SCHEME - Cooling scheme: geometric. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) Perform the simulation in serial -- used 
                          only for debugging purposes, should not be used otherwise. 
                   PAIR - ( default=off ) Pair only the 1st element of the 1st group 
                          with the 1st element in the second, etc. 
                  NLIST - ( default=off ) Use a neighbor list of ligand-protein atom 
                          pairs to speed up the calculating of the distances. 
              NL_CUTOFF - Neighbor list cut-off for the distances of ligand-protein 
                          atom pairs. 
              NL_STRIDE - Update stride for the ligand-protein atom pairs in the 
                          neighbor list. 
                   LOSS - Loss function describing ligand-protein interactions 
                          required by every optimizer.
