Short helpfile for action BF_WAVELETS
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                  ORDER - The order of the basis function expansion. 
                MINIMUM - The minimum of the interval on which the basis functions 
                          are defined. 
                MAXIMUM - The maximum of the interval on which the basis functions 
                          are defined. 
                   TYPE - Specify the wavelet type. Currently available are 
                          DAUBECHIES Wavelets with minimum phase and the more symmetric SYMLETS 

In addition you may use the following options: 

             DEBUG_INFO - ( default=off ) Print out more detailed information about 
                          the basis set. Useful for debugging. 
         MOTHER_WAVELET - ( default=off ) If this flag is set mother wavelets will be 
                          used instead of the scaling function (father wavelet). Makes 
                          only sense for multiresolution, which is at the moment not 
                          usable. 
      DUMP_WAVELET_GRID - ( default=off ) If this flag is set the grid with the 
                          wavelet values will be written to a file. This file is called 
                          wavelet_grid.data. 
               PERIODIC - ( default=off ) Use periodic version of basis set. 
        FUNCTION_LENGTH - The domain size of the individual basis functions. (length) 
                          This is used to alter the scaling of the basis functions. By 
                          default it is set to the total size of the interval. This also 
                          influences the number of actually used basis functions, as all shifted 
                          functions that are partially supported in the CV space are used. 
                 NUM_BF - The number of basis functions that should be used. Includes 
                          the constant one and N-1 shifted wavelets within the specified 
                          range. Cannot be used together with FUNCTION_LENGTH. 
        TAILS_THRESHOLD - The threshold for cutting off tail wavelets as a fraction 
                          of the maximum value. All shifted wavelet functions that only 
                          have values smaller than the threshold in the bias range will be 
                          excluded from the basis set. Defaults to 0 (include all). 
          MIN_GRID_SIZE - The minimal number of grid bins of the Wavelet function. 
                          The true number depends also on the used wavelet type and will 
                          probably be larger. Defaults to 1000. 
       WAVELET_FILE_FMT - The number format of the wavelet grid values and 
                          derivatives written to file. By default it is %15.8f.
