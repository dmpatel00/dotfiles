                 MINIMA - The minimum of the intervals where the target distribution 
                          is taken as uniform. You should give one value for each 
                          argument. 
                 MAXIMA - The maximum of the intervals where the target distribution 
                          is taken as uniform. You should give one value for each 
                          argument. 
           SIGMA_MINIMA - The standard deviation parameters of the Gaussian switching 
                          functions for the minima of the intervals. You should give one value 
                          for each argument. Value of 0.0 means that switch is done 
                          without a smooth switching function, this is the default behavior.
