****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   BIAS - the label of the VES bias to be optimized 
                 STRIDE - the frequency of updating the coefficients given in the 
                          number of MD steps. 
            COEFFS_FILE - ( default=coeffs.data ) the name of output file for the 
                          coefficients 
          COEFFS_OUTPUT - ( default=100 ) how often the coefficients should be 
                          written to file. This parameter is given as the number of 
                          iterations. 
               STEPSIZE - the step size used for the optimization 

In addition you may use the following options: 

MONITOR_INSTANTANEOUS_GRADIENT - ( default=off ) if quantities related to the instantaneous 
                          gradient should be outputted. 
       MULTIPLE_WALKERS - ( default=off ) if optimization is to be performed using 
                          multiple walkers connected via MPI 
START_OPTIMIZATION_AFRESH - ( default=off ) if the iterations should be started afresh 
                          when a restart has been triggered by the RESTART keyword or the 
                          MD code. 
MONITOR_AVERAGE_GRADIENT - ( default=off ) if the averaged gradient should be 
                          monitored and quantities related to it should be outputted. 
             COEFFS_FMT - specify format for coefficient file(s) (useful for decrease 
                          the number of digits in regtests) 
   COEFFS_SET_ID_PREFIX - suffix to add to the filename given in FILE to identify the 
                          bias, should only be given if a single filename is given in FILE 
                          when optimizing multiple biases. 
         INITIAL_COEFFS - the name(s) of file(s) with the initial coefficients 
TARGETDIST_AVERAGES_FILE - the name of output file for the target distribution 
                          averages. By default it is targetdist-averages.data. 
TARGETDIST_AVERAGES_OUTPUT - how often the target distribution averages should be 
                          written out to file. Note that the value is given in terms of 
                          coefficient iterations. If no value is given are the averages only 
                          written at the beginning of the optimization 
            BIAS_OUTPUT - how often the bias(es) should be written out to file. Note 
                          that the value is given in terms of coefficient iterations. 
             FES_OUTPUT - how often the FES(s) should be written out to file. Note 
                          that the value is given in terms of coefficient iterations. 
        FES_PROJ_OUTPUT - how often the projections of the FES(s) should be written 
                          out to file. Note that the value is given in terms of 
                          coefficient iterations. 
                RESTART - allows per-action setting of restart (YES/NO/AUTO) 
            UPDATE_FROM - Only update this action from this time 
           UPDATE_UNTIL - Only update this action until this time 
              MASK_FILE - read in a mask file which allows one to employ different 
                          step sizes for different coefficients and/or deactivate the 
                          optimization of certain coefficients (by putting values of 0.0). One can 
                          write out the resulting mask by using the OUTPUT_MASK_FILE 
                          keyword. 
       OUTPUT_MASK_FILE - Name of the file to write out the mask resulting from using 
                          the MASK_FILE keyword. Can also be used to generate a template 
                          mask file. 
MONITOR_AVERAGES_GRADIENT_EXP_DECAY - use an exponentially decaying averaging with a given time 
                          constant when monitoring the averaged gradient 
      TARGETDIST_STRIDE - stride for updating a target distribution that is 
                          iteratively updated during the optimization. Note that the value is 
                          given in terms of coefficient iterations. 
      TARGETDIST_OUTPUT - how often the dynamic target distribution(s) should be 
                          written out to file. Note that the value is given in terms of 
                          coefficient iterations. 
 TARGETDIST_PROJ_OUTPUT - how often the projections of the dynamic target 
                          distribution(s) should be written out to file. Note that the value is given 
                          in terms of coefficient iterations. 
      EXP_DECAYING_AVER - calculate the averaged coefficients using exponentially 
                          decaying averaging using the decaying constant given here in the 
                          number of iterations
