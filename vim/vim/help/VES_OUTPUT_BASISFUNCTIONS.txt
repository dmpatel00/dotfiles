****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

        BASIS_FUNCTIONS - the label of the basis functions that you want to use 

In addition you may use the following options: 

     IGNORE_PERIODICITY - ( default=off ) if the periodicity of the basis functions 
                          should be ignored. 
  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) if the derivatives of the basis functions 
                          should be calculated numerically. 
              GRID_BINS - the number of bins used for the grid for writing the basis 
                          function values and derivatives. The default value is 1000. 
               GRID_MIN - the minimum of the grid for writing the basis function 
                          values and derivatives. By default it is the minimum of the 
                          interval on which the basis functions are defined. 
               GRID_MAX - the maximum of the grid for writing the basis function 
                          values and derivatives. By default it is the maximum of the 
                          interval on which the basis functions are defined. 
            FILE_VALUES - filename of the file on which the basis function values are 
                          written. By default it is BF_LABEL.values.data. 
            FILE_DERIVS - filename of the file on which the basis function 
                          derivatives are written. By default it is BF_LABEL.derivs.data. 
   FORMAT_VALUES_DERIVS - the numerical format of the basis function values and 
                          derivatives written to file. By default it is %15.8f. . You can also 
                          use FORMAT_VALUES and FORMAT_DERIVS to give the numerical 
                          formats separately. 
          FORMAT_VALUES - the numerical format of the basis function derivatives 
                          written to file. By default it is %15.8f. 
          FORMAT_DERIVS - the numerical format of the basis function values written 
                          to file. By default it is %15.8f. 
FILE_TARGETDIST_AVERAGES - filename of the file on which the averages over the target 
                          distributions are written. By default it is 
                          BF_LABEL.targetdist-averages.data. 
FORMAT_TARGETDIST_AVERAGES - the numerical format of the target distribution averages 
                          written to file. By default it is %15.8f. 
        FILE_TARGETDIST - filename of the files on which the target distributions are 
                          written. By default it is BF_LABEL.targetdist-#.data. 
    TARGET_DISTRIBUTION - the target distribution to be used.. You can use multiple 
                          instances of this keyword i.e. TARGET_DISTRIBUTION1, 
                          TARGET_DISTRIBUTION2, TARGET_DISTRIBUTION3...
