The following arguments are compulsory: 

                    ARG - the label of the ECVs that define the expansion. You can 
                          use an * to make sure all the output components of the ECVs are 
                          used, as in the examples above 
                   PACE - how often the bias is updated 
      OBSERVATION_STEPS - ( default=100 ) number of unbiased initial PACE steps to 
                          collect statistics for initialization 
                   FILE - ( default=DELTAFS ) a file with the estimate of the 
                          relative Delta F for each component of the target and of the global 
                          c(t) 
           PRINT_STRIDE - ( default=100 ) stride for printing to DELTAFS file, in 
                          units of PACE 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
           STORE_STATES - ( default=off ) append to STATE_WFILE instead of ovewriting 
                          it each time 
              CALC_WORK - ( default=off ) calculate the total accumulated work done 
                          by the bias since last restart 
            WALKERS_MPI - ( default=off ) switch on MPI version of multiple walkers 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) perform calculations in serial 
                    FMT - specify format for DELTAFS file 
            STATE_RFILE - read from this file the Delta F estimates and all the info 
                          needed to RESTART the simulation 
            STATE_WFILE - write to this file the Delta F estimates and all the info 
                          needed to RESTART the simulation 
          STATE_WSTRIDE - number of MD steps between writing the STATE_WFILE. Default 
                          is only on CPT events (but not all MD codes set them) 
                RESTART - allows per-action setting of restart (YES/NO/AUTO) 
            UPDATE_FROM - Only update this action from this time 
           UPDATE_UNTIL - Only update this action until this time
