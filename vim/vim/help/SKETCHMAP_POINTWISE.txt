The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

   USE_OUTPUT_DATA_FROM - use the output of the analysis performed by this object as 
                          input to your new analysis object 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

      HIGH_DIM_FUNCTION - ( default=as in input action ) the parameters of the 
                          switching function in the high dimensional space 
       LOW_DIM_FUNCTION - ( default=as in input action ) the parameters of the 
                          switching function in the low dimensional space 
               MIXPARAM - ( default=0.0 ) the amount of the pure distances to mix 
                          into the stress function 
                NCYCLES - ( default=5 ) the number of cycles of global optimization 
                          to attempt 
                  CGTOL - ( default=1E-6 ) the tolerance for the conjugate gradient 
                          minimization 
                 BUFFER - ( default=1.1 ) grid extent for search is (max projection - 
                          minimum projection) multiplied by this value 
             CGRID_SIZE - ( default=10 ) number of points to use in each grid 
                          direction 
             FGRID_SIZE - ( default=0 ) interpolate the grid onto this number of 
                          points -- only works in 2D 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not use 
                          MPI 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements
