Short helpfile for action ECV_LINEAR
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   TEMP - ( default=-1 ) temperature. If not specified tries to get 
                          it from MD engine 
                    ARG - the label of the Hamiltonian difference. 
                 LAMBDA - ( default=0 ) the lambda at which the underlying simulation 
                          runs 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
          DIMENSIONLESS - ( default=off ) ARG is considered dimensionless rather than 
                          an energy, thus is not multiplied by \f$\beta\f$ 
           GEOM_SPACING - ( default=off ) use geometrical spacing in lambda instead 
                          of linear spacing 
             LAMBDA_MIN - ( default=0 ) the minimum of the lambda range 
             LAMBDA_MAX - ( default=1 ) the maximum of the lambda range 
           LAMBDA_STEPS - uniformly place the lambda values, for a total of 
                          LAMBDA_STEPS 
         LAMBDA_SET_ALL - manually set all the lamdbas
