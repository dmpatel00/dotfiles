****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

        BASIS_FUNCTIONS - the label of the one dimensional basis functions that 
                          should be used. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                   TEMP - the system temperature - this is needed if the MD code does 
                          not pass the temperature to PLUMED. 
              BIAS_FILE - filename of the file on which the bias should be written 
                          out. By default it is bias.LABEL.data. Note that suffixes 
                          indicating the iteration number (iter-#) are added to the filename 
                          when optimizing coefficients. 
               FES_FILE - filename of the file on which the FES should be written 
                          out. By default it is fes.LABEL.data. Note that suffixes 
                          indicating the iteration number (iter-#) are added to the filename 
                          when optimizing coefficients. 
        TARGETDIST_FILE - filename of the file on which the target distribution 
                          should be written out. By default it is targetdist.LABEL.data. 
                          Note that suffixes indicating the iteration number (iter-#) are 
                          added to the filename when optimizing coefficients and the target 
                          distribution is dynamic. 
 OPTIMIZATION_THRESHOLD - Threshold value to turn off optimization of localized basis 
                          functions. 
                 COEFFS - read in the coefficients from files. 
    TARGET_DISTRIBUTION - the label of the target distribution to be used. 
            BIAS_CUTOFF - cutoff the bias such that it only fills the free energy 
                          surface up to certain level F_cutoff, here you should give the 
                          value of the F_cutoff. 
BIAS_CUTOFF_FERMI_LAMBDA - the lambda value used in the Fermi switching function for 
                          the bias cutoff (BIAS_CUTOFF), the default value is 10.0. 
              GRID_BINS - the number of bins used for the grid. The default value is 
                          100 bins per dimension. 
               PROJ_ARG - arguments for doing projections of the FES or the target 
                          distribution.. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          PROJ_ARG1, PROJ_ARG2, PROJ_ARG3... 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceeding actions in the input file are taken. 
                          Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of 
                          the output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE 
                          action labelled dist may have three components x, y and z. To take 
                          just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take 
                          all three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag.. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3...
