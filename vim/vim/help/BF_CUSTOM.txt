****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                MINIMUM - The minimum of the interval on which the basis functions 
                          are defined. 
                MAXIMUM - The maximum of the interval on which the basis functions 
                          are defined. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

             DEBUG_INFO - ( default=off ) Print out more detailed information about 
                          the basis set. Useful for debugging. 
               PERIODIC - ( default=off ) Indicate that the basis functions are 
                          periodic. 
          CHECK_NAN_INF - ( default=off ) Check that the basis functions do not 
                          result in a not a number (nan) or infinity (inf). 
                   FUNC - The basis functions f_i(x) given in mathematical 
                          expressions using _x_ as a variable.. You can use multiple instances of 
                          this keyword i.e. FUNC1, FUNC2, FUNC3... 
              TRANSFORM - An optional function that can be used to transform the 
                          argument before calculating the basis function values. You should 
                          use _t_ as a variable. You can use the variables _min_ and 
                          _max_ to give the minimum and the maximum of the interval.
