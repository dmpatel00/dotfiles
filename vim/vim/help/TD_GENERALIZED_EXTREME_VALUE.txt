Short helpfile for action TD_GENERALIZED_EXTREME_VALUE
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

               LOCATION - The mu parameter of the generalized extreme value 
                          distribution. 
                  SCALE - The sigma parameter for the generalized extreme value 
                          distribution given as a positive number. 
                  SHAPE - The xi parameter for the generalized extreme value 
                          distribution. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

          SHIFT_TO_ZERO - ( default=off ) Shift the minimum value of the target 
                          distribution to zero. This can for example be used to avoid negative 
                          values in the target distribution. If this option is active the 
                          distribution will be automatically normalized. 
              NORMALIZE - ( default=off ) Renormalized the target distribution over 
                          the intervals on which it is defined to make sure that it is 
                          properly normalized to 1. In most cases this should not be needed as 
                          the target distributions should be normalized. The code will 
                          issue a warning (but still run) if this is needed for some 
                          reason. 
    WELLTEMPERED_FACTOR - Broaden the target distribution such that it is taken as 
                          [p(s)]^(1/gamma) where gamma is the well tempered factor given here. If this 
                          option is active the distribution will be automatically 
                          normalized.
