Short helpfile for action TD_GRID
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   FILE - The name of the external grid file to be used as a target 
                          distribution. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

           ZERO_OUTSIDE - ( default=off ) By default the target distribution is 
                          continuous such that values outside the boundary of the external grid 
                          file are the same as at the boundary. This can be changed by 
                          using this flag which will make values outside to be taken as 
                          zero. 
       DO_NOT_NORMALIZE - ( default=off ) By default the target distribution from the 
                          external grid is always normalized inside the code. You can use this 
                          flag to disable this normalization. However, be warned that this 
                          will generally lead to the wrong behavior if the distribution 
                          from the external grid is not properly normalized to 1. 
          SHIFT_TO_ZERO - ( default=off ) Shift the minimum value of the target 
                          distribution to zero. This can for example be used to avoid negative 
                          values in the target distribution. If this option is active the 
                          distribution will be automatically normalized. 
                  SHIFT - Shift the grid read in by some constant value. Due to 
                          normalization the final shift in the target distribution will generally 
                          not be the same as the value given here 
    WELLTEMPERED_FACTOR - Broaden the target distribution such that it is taken as 
                          [p(s)]^(1/gamma) where gamma is the well tempered factor given here. If this 
                          option is active the distribution will be automatically 
                          normalized.
