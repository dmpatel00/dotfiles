Short helpfile for action FUNNEL
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                  SCALE - ( default=1.0 ) a factor that multiplies the external 
                          potential, useful to invert free energies 
                   MAXS - ( default=MAXS ) maximum value assumed by fps.lp 
                    ZCC - ( default=ZCC ) switching point between cylinder and cone 
                   FILE - name of the Funnel potential file 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
               NOSPLINE - ( default=off ) specifies that no spline interpolation is 
                          to be used when calculating the energy and forces due to the 
                          external potential 
                 SPARSE - ( default=off ) specifies that the external potential uses 
                          a sparse grid 
                 SPHERE - ( default=off ) The Funnel potential including the binding 
                          site can be spherical instead of a cone 
            WALKERS_MPI - ( default=off ) To be used when gromacs + multiple walkers 
                          are used 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceeding actions in the input file are taken. 
                          Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of 
                          the output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE 
                          action labelled dist may have three components x, y and z. To take 
                          just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take 
                          all three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag.. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3... 
                  NBINS - number of bins along fps.lp 
                  NBINZ - number of bins along fps.ld 
                   MINS - minimum value assumed by fps.lp, if the ligand is able to 
                          go beyond this value the simulation will crash 
                  KAPPA - constant to be used for the funnel-shape restraint 
                          potential 
                   RCYL - radius of the cylindrical section 
                 SAFETY - To be used in case the SPHERE flag is chosen, it regulates 
                          how much the potential extends (in nm) 
                  SLOPE - Adjust the behavior of the potential outside the funnel, 
                          greater values than 1.0 will tend to push the ligand more towards 
                          the cylinder and vice versa 
                  ALPHA - angle to change the width of the cone section
