Short helpfile for action TD_LINEAR_COMBINATION
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

          DISTRIBUTIONS - The labels of the target distribution actions to be used in 
                          the linear combination. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

              NORMALIZE - ( default=off ) Renormalized the target distribution over 
                          the intervals on which it is defined to make sure that it is 
                          properly normalized to 1. In most cases this should not be needed as 
                          the target distributions should be normalized. The code will 
                          issue a warning (but still run) if this is needed for some 
                          reason. 
                WEIGHTS - The weights of target distributions. Have to be as many as 
                          the number of target distribution labels given in 
                          DISTRIBUTIONS. If no weights are given the distributions are weighted 
                          equally. The weights are automatically normalized to 1. 
    WELLTEMPERED_FACTOR - Broaden the target distribution such that it is taken as 
                          [p(s)]^(1/gamma) where gamma is the well tempered factor given here. If this 
                          option is active the distribution will be automatically 
                          normalized.
