Short helpfile for action SKETCH_MAP
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

               NLOW_DIM - the dimension of the low dimensional space in which the 
                          projections will be constructed 
                 MATRIX - the matrix of distances between points that you want to 
                          reproduce in your sketch-map projection 
      HIGH_DIM_FUNCTION - the parameters of the switching function in the high 
                          dimensional space 
       LOW_DIM_FUNCTION - the parameters of the switching function in the low 
                          dimensional space 
            ANNEAL_RATE - ( default=0.5 ) the rate at which to do the annealing 
           ANNEAL_STEPS - ( default=10 ) the number of steps of annealing to do 
                  CGTOL - ( default=1E-6 ) the tolerance for the conjugate gradient 
                          minimization 
                NCYCLES - ( default=5 ) the number of cycles of global optimization 
                          to attempt 
                 BUFFER - ( default=1.1 ) grid extent for search is (max projection - 
                          minimum projection) multiplied by this value 
             CGRID_SIZE - ( default=10 ) number of points to use in each grid 
                          direction 
             FGRID_SIZE - ( default=0 ) interpolate the grid onto this number of 
                          points -- only works in 2D
