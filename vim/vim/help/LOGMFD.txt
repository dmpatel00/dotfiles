The following arguments are compulsory: 

               INTERVAL - Period of MD steps (\f$N_m\f$) to update fictitious 
                          dynamical variables. 
                DELTA_T - Time step for the fictitious dynamical variables (DELTA_T=1 
                          often works). 
             THERMOSTAT - Type of thermostat for the fictitious dynamical variables. 
                          NVE, NVT, VS are available. 
                  KAPPA - Spring constant of the harmonic restraining potential. 
               FICT_MAX - Maximum values reachable for the fictitious dynamical 
                          variables. The variables will elastically bounce back at the boundary 
                          (mirror boundary). 
               FICT_MIN - Minimum values reachable for the fictitious dynamical 
                          variables. The variables will elastically bounce back at the boundary 
                          (mirror boundary). 
                   FLOG - The initial free energy value in the LogMFD/PD run.The 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceeding actions in the input file are taken. 
                          Some actions have multi-component outputs and each component of 
                          the output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE 
                          action labelled dist may have three components x, y and z. To take 
                          just the x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take 
                          all three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag.. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3... 
                   TEMP - Target temperature for the fictitious dynamical variables 
                          in LogMFD/PD. It is recommended to set TEMP to be the same as 
                          the temperature of the MD system in any thermostated LogMFD/PD 
                          run. If not provided, it will be taken from the temperature of 
                          the MD system (Gromacs only). 
                   TAMD - When TAMD=1, TAMD/d-AFED calculations can be performed 
                          instead of LogMFD. Otherwise, the LogMFD protocol is switched on 
                          (default). 
                  ALPHA - Alpha parameter for LogMFD. If not provided or provided as 
                          0, it will be taken as 1/gamma. If gamma is also not provided, 
                          Alpha is set as 4, which is a sensible value when the unit of 
                          kcal/mol is used. 
                  GAMMA - Gamma parameter for LogMFD. If not provided or provided as 
                          0, it will be taken as 1/alpha. If alpha is also not provided, 
                          Gamma is set as 0.25, which is a sensible value when the unit of 
                          kcal/mol is used. 
                   FICT - The initial values of the fictitious dynamical variables. 
                          If not provided, they are set equal to their corresponding CVs 
                          for the initial atomic configuration. 
                  VFICT - The initial velocities of the fictitious dynamical 
                          variables. If not provided, they will be taken as 0. If THERMOSTAT=VS, 
                          they are instead automatically adjusted according to TEMP. 
                  MFICT - Masses of each fictitious dynamical variable. If not 
                          provided, they will be taken as 10000. 
                   XETA - The initial eta variable of the Nose-Hoover thermostat for 
                          the fictitious dynamical variables. If not provided, it will be 
                          taken as 0. 
                   VETA - The initial velocity of eta variable. If not provided, it 
                          will be taken as 0. 
                   META - Mass of eta variable. 
                   WORK - The initial value of the work done by fictitious dynamical 
                          variables in each replica. If not provided, it will be taken as 0. 
                 TEMPPD - Temperature of the Boltzmann factor in the Jarzynski weight 
                          in LogPD (Gromacs only). TEMPPD should be the same as the 
                          temperature of the MD system, while TEMP may be (in principle) 
                          different from it. If not provided, TEMPPD is set to be the same 
                          value as TEMP.
