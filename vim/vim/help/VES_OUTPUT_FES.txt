Short helpfile for action VES_OUTPUT_FES
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   BIAS - the label of the VES bias for to output the free energy 
                          surfaces and the bias files 
           COEFFS_INPUT - the name of input coefficient file 
            BIAS_OUTPUT - how often the bias(es) should be written out to file. Note 
                          that the value is given in terms of coefficient iterations. 
             FES_OUTPUT - how often the FES(s) should be written out to file. Note 
                          that the value is given in terms of coefficient iterations. 
        FES_PROJ_OUTPUT - how often the projections of the FES(s) should be written 
                          out to file. Note that the value is given in terms of 
                          coefficient iterations.
