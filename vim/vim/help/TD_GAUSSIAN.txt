The following options are available

          SHIFT_TO_ZERO - ( default=off ) Shift the minimum value of the target 
                          distribution to zero. This can for example be used to avoid negative 
                          values in the target distribution. If this option is active the 
                          distribution will be automatically normalized. 
              NORMALIZE - ( default=off ) Renormalized the target distribution over 
                          the intervals on which it is defined to make sure that it is 
                          properly normalized to 1. In most cases this should not be needed as 
                          the target distributions should be normalized. The code will 
                          issue a warning (but still run) if this is needed for some 
                          reason. 
                 CENTER - The centers of the Gaussian distributions.. You can use 
                          multiple instances of this keyword i.e. CENTER1, CENTER2, CENTER3... 
                  SIGMA - The standard deviations of the Gaussian distributions.. You 
                          can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. SIGMA1, SIGMA2, 
                          SIGMA3... 
            CORRELATION - The correlation for two-dimensional bivariate Gaussian 
                          distributions. Only works for two arguments. The value should be between 
                          -1 and 1. If no value is given the Gaussian kernels is 
                          considered as un-correlated (i.e. value of 0.0).. You can use multiple 
                          instances of this keyword i.e. CORRELATION1, CORRELATION2, 
                          CORRELATION3... 
                WEIGHTS - The weights of the Gaussian distributions. Have to be as 
                          many as the number of centers given with the numbered CENTER 
                          keywords. If no weights are given the distributions are weighted 
                          equally. The weights are automatically normalized to 1. 
    WELLTEMPERED_FACTOR - Broaden the target distribution such that it is taken as 
                          [p(s)]^(1/gamma) where gamma is the well tempered factor given here. If this 
                          option is active the distribution will be automatically 
                          normalized.
