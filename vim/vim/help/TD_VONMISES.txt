Short helpfile for action TD_VONMISES
****************************************

The following options are available

          SHIFT_TO_ZERO - ( default=off ) Shift the minimum value of the target 
                          distribution to zero. This can for example be used to avoid negative 
                          values in the target distribution. If this option is active the 
                          distribution will be automatically normalized. 
                 CENTER - The centers of the Von Mises distributions.. You can use 
                          multiple instances of this keyword i.e. CENTER1, CENTER2, CENTER3... 
                  SIGMA - The standard deviations of the Von Mises distributions.. 
                          You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. SIGMA1, 
                          SIGMA2, SIGMA3... 
                WEIGHTS - The weights of the Von Mises distributions. Have to be as 
                          many as the number of centers given with the numbered CENTER 
                          keywords. If no weights are given the distributions are weighted 
                          equally. The weights are automatically normalized to 1. 
    WELLTEMPERED_FACTOR - Broaden the target distribution such that it is taken as 
                          [p(s)]^(1/gamma) where gamma is the well tempered factor given here. If this 
                          option is active the distribution will be automatically 
                          normalized.
